Click anywhere in the frame and a dialog box will appear for you to
choose a color for a point to be generated where you clicked.
Repeat this process for two more points.
Finally, click again in the frame and the program will interpolate
the colors at each point across the face of the triangle generated
by connecting the three points you chose.
